## Overview

I got [this website](https://www.bakkerijlieven.com/) to work on. It's a little bakery that I actually know myself.

### What needed to change

They made this website themselves and you can tell. It doesn't look very professional.
So to get a more professional feel, we decided to strip it down to a more minimalistic and cleaner layout.

There are some unnecessary pages like in the "het assortiment" section. These pages can easily be combined into one page.

## The result

## Reflection

It wasn't an easy task for me because I built it in Bootstrap and I feel I could have done it faster if I just wrote everything myself with grid and flexbox. 

The main issue I had was to decide what styling I wrote with Bootstrap classes and what styling I wrote myself in CSS. I didn't find one correct way to do that...

The only reason I used Bootstrap was because of the responsive menu. I can't write that myself (yet).

If I were to do this exercise again, I would probably look for a tutorial on how to make that myself instead of forcing myself to use Bootstrap. I know it's usefull to create sites really fast but I like a bit more control over my design. I feel like you're stuck with Bootstrap's way of thinking (if that makes sense?).

### Conclusion
All in all, it went okay and I managed to finish it very fast (once I put my head down). I'm not really sure what to think about Bootstrap though... So that's a bit of a letdown. 

The one thing I need to work on is that I still feel like my code is a bit chaotic. It's getting better but at the end of a project, Bootstrap didn't help with that ofcourse.
